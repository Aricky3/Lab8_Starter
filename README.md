1. 1 because that would trigger the test that is associated with the issue to be ran whenever it is pushed and would make identifying the causes of errors easier.
2. No, we would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output because end to end tests are used to emulate potential user action scenarios.
3. No, we would not use a unit test because end to end testing would be better suited to test the "message" feature because end to end testing can simulate a scenario of a user writing and sending a message to another user. Unit tests cannot be used to test how individual components interact with each other.
4. Yes, we would use a unit test because testing the "max message length" of a message is a simple test of an individual component in the messaging application which can be easily accomplished with a unit test. It does not require testing how individual components interact so a unit test would work well.
